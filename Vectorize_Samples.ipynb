    "# Vectorization of Samples\n",
    "To conserve resources and prepare the samples for final ingest, the last thing we need to do is turn all of the samples into vectors. This will be done using a custom tokenizer similar to that in tokenization.ipynb in MalDroid_feature_engineering repo. It will take the sample.apk.json files as a string and convert them to index ints. Due to the large size of our training dataset and the potential for the future computation of additional n-grams, performance and reusability will be optimized. The vocabulary.txt file from the aforementioned repo has been copied to local.\n",

    "1. Fetch sample and load as dict, extract list of behaviors\n",
    "2. Call multisort function, ordering by id then ts \n",
    "3. For behavior in sorted list, drop unused keys\n",
    "4. Cast each dict in sorted list to string and add to str list of behaviors\n",
    "5. Initalize vector with SOA index, For behavior in list, call tokenizer function passing vector: \n",
